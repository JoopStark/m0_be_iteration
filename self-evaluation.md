# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
    -I assume when dealing with arrays that you will usually want specific data or want to alter data or some combination, so being able to modify individual pieces would be more more efficient than on at a time. 
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
    -I definetly need practice. It does not come as natually as the prior skills. I will see if I can solve a bunch of math problems using the each method. 
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
    - Reading through the assignment and following all directions helped. I also googled the "Starts with 'P' challange" using technical terms which helped.
